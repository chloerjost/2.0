        <p>With this website, I want to create a feeling of fun, clean, continuity. The main area of interest to me is the way in which it will flow. I want to have my menu items stacked in the bottom left corner with my webpage title (Hey there! It’s Chloe!) in the top left corner. Instead of each menu item redirecting to a separate page, I would like to have one continuous main page that can be navigated to the next section by either scrolling or page jumping to get there quickly. The webpage title will be fixed and to link back to the top/home/about me section.
As the user scrolls down, I want there to be some very obvious visual changes. For explanation purposes, assume that the order of the menu links will be Submission 1, Submission 2, Skill, Presentation... The background of each section will be a different color. For using the sidebar menu links to jump to each section, I am assuming this will be simple to code. For scrolling purposes, I want the background color of the new section to look like it is pushing up that of the previous one. Also, I want the menu item of the new section to move up along the sidebar menu until it stops at the top left under the website title. So, when you have scrolled all the way to the bottom of the website, all the menu items will be stacked in the top left in the same manner as they were at the bottom left. The divide between the background colors should occur about an inch or so above the menu item, so that when the menu item gets to the top and stops scrolling, the new background color will also have just hit the top of the screen and will also stop scrolling.
I plan to use a non-serif font (Helvetica) to keep it clean. I want to use a Miami design-inspired color scheme (mango, pale blue, millennial pink, teal, pale yellow, gray) in conjunction with 80s-inspired patterns (tic tac shapes, triangles, squiggles). If I can find a way to make it not too busy, I might animate some of these patterns to move back and forth… that will be the last thing I try to tackle.
The purpose of this website for me is to learn how to really manipulate CSS to make it do what I want because I am approaching this from a design point of view. While the audience is likely just going to be this class, I want the website to be more conversational so that if someone from a small design firm with a laid-back office culture were to look at it, they would think that I would be a good fit. Although I’m putting the About Me in 3rd person, I want it to still be clear that I am the author.</p>
